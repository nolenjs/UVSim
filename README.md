 Team project for CS2450

To begin working on the repository (aka "repo"):
1) Open your desired IDE and folder to save your work
2) Open a terminal and "cd" into your desired filepath to your work
3) Run "git clone https://github.com/nolenjs/UVSim.git" in the terminal
4) Change directories into the newly cloned repo
5) Create your own branch to work out of without interfering with others
    (ex. "git checkout -b nolen")
6) Have fun!
