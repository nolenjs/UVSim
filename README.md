Team #2 project for CS2450

To begin working on the repository (aka "repo"):

Open your desired IDE and folder to save your work
Open a terminal and "cd" into your desired filepath to your work
Run "git clone https://github.com/nolenjs/UVSim.git" in the terminal
Change directories into the newly cloned repo
Create your own branch to work out of without interfering with others (ex. "git checkout -b nolen")
Have fun!

To run UVSim:

2. Create/provide a BasicML program in a txt file then name it "program.txt"
3. Run in the terminal "python uvsim.py" or "python3 uvsim.py"
4. Let it work its magic!
